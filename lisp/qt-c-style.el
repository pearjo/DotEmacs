;;; Commentary:

;; This style is based upon the `google-c-style' library and changed
;; according to Qt's code style.  You may wish to add `qt-set-c-style'
;; to your `c-mode-common-hook' after requiring this file.  For
;; example:
;;
;;    (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'qt-set-c-style)
;;
;; If you want the RETURN key to go to the next line and space over
;; to the right place, add this to your .emacs right after the load-file:
;;
;;    (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'qt-make-newline-indent)

;;; Code:

;; For some reason 1) c-backward-syntactic-ws is a macro and 2)  under Emacs 22
;; bytecode cannot call (unexpanded) macros at run time:
(eval-when-compile (require 'cc-defs))

;; Wrapper function needed for Emacs 21 and XEmacs (Emacs 22 offers the more
;; elegant solution of composing a list of lineup functions or quantities with
;; operators such as "add")

  "Indent to the beginning of the current C expression plus 4 spaces.

This implements title \"Function Declarations and Definitions\" of the Qt
C++ Style Guide for the case where the previous line ends with an open
parentheses.

\"Current C expression\", as per the Qt Style Guide and as clarified by
subsequent discussions,
means the whole expression regardless of the number of nested parentheses, but
excluding non-expression material such as \"if(\" and \"for(\" control
structures.

Suitable for inclusion in `c-offsets-alist'."
